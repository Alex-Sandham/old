	<li>&bull;<b>Jullia Western:</b> </br><ins>Well organised and fun</ins></br>Excellent rooms, there are little playgrounds dotted around the place.</br>The staff are very good with children, for example Brandon who did a magic trick to keep the children entertained while they were waiting for the water slide. Outdoor pool is good and also the indoor. The best activities are archery and den building</a></li>
	<li><br>&bull;<b>Charlie Flow</b><br><ins>Amazing family holiday !!</ins><br>We came away to celebrate my husbands 30th Birthday with our 4 year old son, both our parents, aunties & uncles. We were greeted by lovely reception staff, taken into a private room, offered a drink and were taken through our accommodation, activities, etc. We then pulled up to our caravan no 1 the green (platinum) and were absolutely over the moon, it was worth every penny. The caravan had its own car parking space, in a great location, the inside was beautiful, spacious and had everything we could possibly need. All the little extras made it so much more special; the Bluetooth speakers in each room, lovely fire, dishwasher, large fridge freezer, balcony, prime location, the list goes on. The park had everything you could wish for, the beach was lovely and clean with beautiful views, the entertainment was brilliant, staff were extremely friendly and couldn’t do enough for you, plenty of activities for children and various places to eat; pizza, Chinese, chip shop etc. We can’t wait to come back again over Easter !!</li>
